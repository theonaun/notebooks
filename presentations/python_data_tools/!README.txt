Generally

This is a presentation created for the purpose of introducing individuals with at least some familiarity with the Python language to the array of tools availible for Python data analysis. It has two primary sections:

1) a brief overview of Jupyter, Python, matplotlib, numpy, SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn (sections 01 through 09); and,
2) a series of exercises (sections 10 through 18).

Requirements
===
This presentation is intended to be stepped through in an interactive manner. It requires a Jupyter Notebook (most easily acquired through the Anaconda3 installer created by Continuum Analytics [https://www.continuum.io/]. It has only been tested with Microsoft Windows 7 with Anaconda3 version 4.1.1.
