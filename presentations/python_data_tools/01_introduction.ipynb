    "\n",
    "1) Ask questions! I may not be able to give you an answer off the top of my head, but I can probably make something up.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Join our internal Python Users Group and download Anaconda3 from the [HP Service Manager](https://itsm.us.bank-dns.com/sm9/ess.do) if you haven't already.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Check the hyperlinks. We've got limited time and there are some really good resources (from people smarter than me).\n",

    "\n",
    "a) Two sessions separate sessions. The idea is to burn through notebooks 1 through 9 as quickly as possible, and then do the exercises as we have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The first of these sessions is intended to give you the high level view as to what's out there with respect to Python data analysis tools. For the purposes of demonstration, we will be using Anaconda3 instead of a PowerPoint deck, which is availible in the bank free of cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The second of these sessions is intended to give you a more hands on approach to how you might tackle a particular problem or set of problems."
